title: Auction Zero to Hero 
sidebar_label: Introduction
---

In this Zero to Hero series, you'll learn to build an auction smart contract that allows an auctioneer to list an NFT and have people bid with FTs This series will slowly build up in complexity, teaching you about several key primitives and concepts along the way:
- Using block_timestamp
- Locking a contract 
- Making cross-contract calls
- Sending Non-Fungible Tokens
- Sending and receiving Fungible Tokens 

This tutorial comes with contracts written in both TypeScript and Rust.
